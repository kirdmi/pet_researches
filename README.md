[Exploring the Relationship Between Historical Events and Interest in Occult and Mystique: A Statistical Analysis](https://github.com/kirdmi/pet_researches/blob/main/project_myst.ipynb)

People have historically shown a heightened interest in occultism and mystique during times of distress. This research aims to understand the changes in people's perspectives and their inclination to dissociate from reality by examining studies conducted over the past 15 years. By analyzing monthly search interest data for occultism-related keywords, significant increases in Numerology and Runes in 2022 were observed, indicating a growing fascination with these topics. The findings shed light on evolving trends and suggest the influence of cultural and historical factors. Further research can explore underlying factors and the impact of media and technology on occult knowledge.
